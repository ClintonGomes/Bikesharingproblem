## Prediction of Bike Sharing Demand
### Problem Statetment
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.  
- How well those variables describe the bike demands  

We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

### Steps for Model Building
1.Reading and Understanding Data  
2.Visualising the Data  
3.Data Preparation  
4.Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets  
5.Feature Scaling  
6.Building the Model  
7.Residual Analysis of the train data  
8.Making predictions using final model  
9.Model Evaluation
